# Classic Snake Game

This repository contains the Python code for a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Snake game. The game is designed to be run in a Python environment, utilizing the `turtle` graphics library for rendering the game's graphics.

## Files Description

- `data.txt`: Contains game configuration or data (specific contents and purpose should be described based on its content).
- `food.py`: Manages the food object in the game, including its appearance and placement on the screen.
- `main.py`: The main driver script that initializes the game window, game loop, and integrates all game components.
- `scoreboard.py`: Handles the display and updating of the score during the game.
- `snake.py`: Defines the Snake class, including its behavior, movements, and how it grows after eating food.

## How to Play

To play the game, you will need Python installed on your computer. After cloning this repository, navigate to the cloned directory and run the main.py


Control the snake using the arrow keys. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's own tail.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle Graphics Library (should come with Python)
